# simple-food-store-idea
this is a project I made for......for just learning, that's it. It's similar to another program, but the basics is this: you're given a list of categories to pick from. then you pick. then a list of foods come out and the prices. pick the one you want, then go to the next category, until you've visited each category. then pay....that's all.

#what the program does in detailed:
First - a user is presented with the list of category titles
Second - then the user picks a category and then they are shown a list of foods under that category
third - the user picks 1 item that they want from the list and they are taken back to the main list
fourth - once back, the user can go to another category or go back to the same category as before and pick what they want
fifth - once they pick what they want in that category, they are sent to another category and the price is added to their total
sixth - once the user is done, at the bottom, the user can enter "Done" or "done" and they are shown their total
seventh - the user pays and the program ends
