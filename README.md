# simple-food-store-idea
this is a project I made for......for just learning, that's it. It's similar to another program, but the basics is this: you're given a list of categories to pick from. then you pick. then a list of foods come out and the prices. pick the one you want, then go to the next category, until you've visited each category. then pay....that's all.
